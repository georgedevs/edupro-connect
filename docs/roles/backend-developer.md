# Backend Developer Role Document â€“ EduPro Connect

This document outlines the responsibilities, expectations, and working practices for the Backend Developer role within the EduPro Connect project. It is intended to serve as a guide for developers to understand their contributions to the project's overall success.

---

## 1. Role Overview

The Backend Developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic that powers EduPro Connect. This role involves designing, developing, and testing RESTful APIs, implementing robust authentication mechanisms, and ensuring secure, optimized data transactions. By working closely with the Frontend Developer, the Backend Developer ensures that data flows seamlessly and securely between the client interface and the database, facilitating a robust and user-friendly experience for students and educators.

Key aspects of this role include:
- Implementing business logic and endpoints for user authentication, course management, and real-time communication.
- Ensuring the server infrastructure is scalable, maintainable, and secure.
- Collaborating with the team to integrate third-party educational APIs and external resources.

---

## 2. Key Responsibilities

### a. Develop RESTful APIs & Implement Robust Authentication
- **What It Involves:**  
  - Designing and building RESTful endpoints using Node.js and Express.
  - Handling routes for user authentication (login, registration, password resets) and session management.
  - Example: Creating an endpoint for user login that verifies credentials and returns a secure JSON Web Token (JWT).
  
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
  const router = express.Router();

  // Example: User Login Endpoint
  router.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    // Validate credentials (pseudo-code)
    const user = await authService.validateUser(username, password);
    if (user) {
      const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
      res.json({ token });
    } else {
      res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }
  });

  module.exports = router;
  ```

### b. Manage Data Persistence & Ensure Secure Data Transactions
- **What It Involves:**  
  - Designing database schemas and ensuring proper indexing for performance.
  - Developing data access layers using an ORM or query builder.
  - Implementing security measures such as input validation, SQL injection prevention, and encrypted communication.
  - Example: Creating a data model for course management and ensuring smooth CRUD operations.

  ```javascript
  // Example: Sequelize model for a Course
  module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
    const Course = sequelize.define('Course', {
      title: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false
      },
      description: DataTypes.TEXT,
    });
    return Course;
  };
  ```

### c. Optimize Server Performance & Support Backend Scalability
- **What It Involves:**  
  - Profiling and monitoring application performance.
  - Implementing caching strategies (e.g., Redis) and load balancing if necessary.
  - Refactoring code and database queries for efficiency.
  - Example: Caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

  ```javascript
  const redis = require('redis');
  const client = redis.createClient();

  // Example: Caching a database query result
  async function getCourseData(courseId) {
    const cacheKey = `course:${courseId}`;
    const cachedData = await client.getAsync(cacheKey);
    if (cachedData) {
      return JSON.parse(cachedData);
    }
    const courseData = await db.Course.findByPk(courseId);
    await client.setex(cacheKey, 3600, JSON.stringify(courseData));
    return courseData;
  }
  ```

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Node.js:**  
  Proficiency in Node.js for building scalable server-side applications.
  
- **Express:**  
  Experience with the Express framework to set up RESTful API endpoints, middleware, and routing.
  
- **Database Management:**  
  Knowledge of relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and/or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB). Experience with ORMs like Sequelize or Mongoose is beneficial.
  
- **Security Practices:**  
  Understanding of authentication protocols (JWT, OAuth), secure password storage, and common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
  
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Familiarity with caching, query optimization, and scalability best practices.

---

## 4. Deliverables

The Backend Developer is expected to deliver the following:

- Complete set of RESTful API endpoints supporting:
  - User authentication and session management.
  - Course and assignment CRUD operations.
  - Real-time chat and notifications features.
  
- Documentation for API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Postman collections.
  
- Unit and integration tests covering key functionality, with clear documentation on how to run these tests.
  
- Scalable and secure database schema designs and data access layers.
  
- Code that adheres to best practices around performance, security, and maintainability.

---

## 5. Integration Points

- **With Frontend Developer:**
  - Define API contracts including request and response payload formats.
  - Maintain open channels for communication to address changes in requirements or data formats.
  - Use version control (e.g., Git) and shared repositories for coordinated code integration.

- **With QA and DevOps:**
  - Collaborate on testing strategies and monitoring performance metrics.
  - Assist in setting up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.

- **With Project Manager:**
  - Provide regular updates on backend development progress.
  - Address any issues related to API performance or security promptly.

---

## 6. Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- **Feature Branches:**  
  Each new functionality or improvement should be developed in its own feature branch derived from the main branch.
  
- **Pull Requests & Code Reviews:**  
  Submit pull requests for each completed feature. Code reviews should focus on adherence to best practices, security vulnerabilities, and integration impacts.
  
- **Merging:**  
  Merge feature branches into the main branch only after successful code review and passing all automated tests.

### Code Review Process
- Use peer reviews to ensure code quality and sharing of knowledge.
- Integrate linters and static code analysis tools (such as ESLint) to maintain code consistency.
- Adopt test-driven development where feasible to reduce bugs and improve maintainability.

### Testing Approach
- Use frameworks such as Mocha, Jest, or Chai for unit and integration testing.
- Ensure that each endpoint has tests covering both expected behavior and error cases.
- Automate testing as part of the CI workflow.

- **API Structuring:**  
  Defining RESTful endpoint patterns and ensuring consistency in request handling.
  
- **Authentication & Session Management:**  
  Choosing authentication strategies (e.g., JWT vs. session-based) and implementing them securely.
  
- **Database Schema Design:**  
  Designing tables and relationships that best represent course and user data while ensuring scalability.
  
- **Performance Enhancements:**  
  Deciding on strategies for caching, load balancing, and other optimizations as the user base grows.
